Essentials to know as AICIPers

## General system and software knowledge

Even as an engineer student, it is necessary to sharpen your computer science skills in both breadth and depth, which may include:

* Learn to write readable and maintainable code.
* Learn to admin (setup service, trouble shoot) on a Linux box.
* Learn to set up and manage a container (docker) or VM (vmware or virtualbox) environment.
* Learn common data structure & algorithms
* Learn and master at least one code editor: be it vim, vs code, or sublime.
* Learn Latex typesetting
* Learn to give a presentation.


## Git (for source control management)

There are many tutorials and teaching videos, prepare yourself to have a working knowledge of git and its core concepts such as commit, branch, merge, team workflow (pull request), resolving conflict0 etc.

* [Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners (30 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)
* [Git branching and merging (30 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyAAIHHClqI)
* [Git advanced tutorial (60 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SJCYPsef54)

## Python and its ecosystem (for general programming and data analysis)

You need to have hands-on experience on how to install and manage Python environment using `conda` or `pip`; you need to know how to package and distribute a pure Python module; and you need to know how to integrate C/C++ into Python.

* [Python tutorial (6.0 hr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) - you can skip Django project if you want, which is not really required.

* [Jupyter Notebook, 30 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk&t=4s)

* [Numpy tutorial (2.5 hr)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0D2mhVt7NE&t=19s)

* [Matplotlib tutorial (60 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKJyGzgWP6c) 

* [Panda tutorial (60 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfVxFV1ZPnk)

## Image Processing

You should at least know about [OpenCV] (http://www.opencv.org) and [dlib](http://dlib.net/), or both.
